# BiteAway
Iâ€™m building a fully functional food ordering website with a modern UI using React, Tailwind CSS, and Redux for state management. The backend will be powered by Spring Boot, with REST APIs, MySQL for the database, and Spring Security for authentication. The project will also use Postman for API testing and Git/GitHub for version control.
